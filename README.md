The **Blind Stick** project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor and a vibration motor or buzzer to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting nearby obstacles. The sensor emits sound waves and calculates the distance to objects by measuring the time taken for the sound to bounce back. When an obstacle is detected within a predefined range (30 cm by default), the stick triggers vibrations or audio alerts, warning the user. This open-source project provides a simple, efficient way to enhance mobility and safety for the blind, making it a valuable tool for independent navigation.
